                    <p>This year's Annual Spring Festival shattered all previous attendance records, drawing over 5,000 students, faculty, staff, and community members to campus for a day of celebration, culture, and connection.</p>
                    
                    <p>The festival, held on the main quad under perfect spring weather, featured three stages of continuous entertainment. The main stage hosted performances by local bands, student musical groups, and a surprise appearance by Grammy-nominated artist Maya Chen, a 2019 alumna.</p>
                    
                    <p>Food trucks lined the perimeter of the quad, offering everything from Korean BBQ to artisanal ice cream. The International Student Association organized a cultural pavilion where students shared traditional foods, crafts, and performances from their home countries.</p>
                    
                    <p>"The energy was absolutely incredible," said Emma Rodriguez, Student Activities Coordinator. "Seeing our entire community come together like this reminds us why events like these are so important for building connections and celebrating our diversity."</p>
                    
                    <p>Highlights included a student art exhibition, a sustainability fair featuring eco-friendly vendors, and interactive workshops ranging from pottery making to coding basics. The children's area, complete with face painting and games, was particularly popular with faculty and staff families.</p>
                    
                    <p>Planning for next year's festival begins this summer, with organizers already exploring ways to accommodate even larger crowds while maintaining the intimate, community feel that makes the event special.</p>

                    <p>In a heart-stopping overtime thriller that had the home crowd on their feet, the Eagles basketball team secured their spot in the regional championships with a 78-75 victory over the defending champions, the State University Wolves.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game was a back-and-forth battle from the opening tip. Senior captain Marcus Johnson led the Eagles with 24 points and 8 rebounds, while sophomore guard Lisa Chen contributed crucial three-pointers in the final minutes of regulation to force overtime.</p>
                    
                    <p>"I've never been more proud of a team," said Head Coach David Wilson, who is in his eighth season with the Eagles. "These players have shown incredible heart, determination, and growth throughout the season. They've earned this opportunity."</p>
                    
                    <p>The Eagles trailed by 12 points with just eight minutes remaining in regulation, but a furious comeback led by Johnson and Chen, combined with stellar defensive play from junior forward Alex Thompson, brought the team back into contention.</p>
                    
                    <p>In overtime, the Eagles controlled the pace and executed their plays flawlessly. A steal and fast-break layup by Chen with 45 seconds remaining proved to be the game-winner, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.</p>
                    
                    <p>This marks the Eagles' first regional championship appearance since 2019. They will face the winner of tomorrow's semifinal game between Metro College and Riverside University. The regional championship game is scheduled for Saturday at 7 PM at the neutral site Civic Center Arena.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tickets for the championship game go on sale Wednesday morning through the athletics department website.</p>

                    <p>A comprehensive sustainability initiative launched by the student-led Green Campus Committee has achieved remarkable results in its first semester, reducing overall campus waste by 40% and setting a new standard for environmental responsibility in higher education.</p>
                    
                    <p>The program, called "Zero Waste Eagles," implemented a multi-pronged approach including expanded recycling programs, composting initiatives, reusable container programs in dining halls, and campus-wide education campaigns.</p>
                    
                    <p>"When we started this initiative, we hoped to make a difference, but these results have exceeded our wildest expectations," said Sarah Martinez, a junior environmental science major and committee chair. "It shows what's possible when the entire campus community commits to change."</p>
                    
                    <p>Key components of the program include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Installation of 50 new recycling stations across campus with clear, visual sorting guides</li>
                        <li>A campus-wide composting program that diverts food waste from dining halls and residence halls</li>
                        <li>Reusable container programs that have eliminated over 15,000 single-use containers per month</li>
                        <li>Monthly "Waste Audit" events where students analyze and sort campus waste to identify improvement opportunities</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The initiative has also generated significant cost savings for the college. Reduced waste disposal fees and recycling revenue have created a $50,000 annual budget surplus that will be reinvested in additional sustainability projects.</p>
                    
                    <p>Plans for the spring semester include expanding the program to include electronic waste recycling, implementing a campus bike-share program, and launching a student-run sustainability consulting service for local businesses.</p>
                    
                    <p>The success has attracted attention from other colleges nationwide, with delegations from five universities scheduled to visit campus this spring to learn about the program's implementation.</p>

                    <p>Sarah Kim '18 returned to campus last week as a guest lecturer, sharing her remarkable journey from computer science student to successful tech entrepreneur with current students in the Computer Science and Business departments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Kim, who graduated summa cum laude with a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration, is the founder and CEO of EcoTrack, a sustainability software platform that helps businesses monitor and reduce their environmental impact. Her company recently completed a $15 million Series A funding round.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Standing in that lecture hall brought back so many memories," Kim reflected. "I remember sitting in those same seats, wondering if I had what it takes to make it in tech. I want current students to know that with passion, persistence, and the right support system, anything is possible."</p>
                    
                    <p>During her time as a student, Kim was actively involved in the Women in Technology club, served as a teaching assistant for introductory programming courses, and completed internships at both startups and established tech companies. She credits her professors and the college's emphasis on hands-on learning for preparing her for entrepreneurship.</p>
                    
                    <p>EcoTrack, launched just two years after graduation, now serves over 500 companies worldwide and has helped clients reduce their carbon footprint by an average of 25%. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze energy usage, waste patterns, and supply chain data to provide actionable sustainability recommendations.</p>
                    
                    <p>"The liberal arts foundation I received here taught me to think critically and communicate effectively," Kim explained. "In tech, you need more than just coding skills – you need to understand people, markets, and how to solve real-world problems."</p>
                    
                    <p>Kim announced during her visit that EcoTrack will be offering paid internships to five students from the college each summer, with opportunities in software development, data analysis, and business development. Applications will be available through the Career Services office starting next month.</p>
                    
                    <p>She also committed to establishing an annual scholarship fund for underrepresented students in STEM fields, with the first awards to be given in the fall semester.</p>

                    <p>The annual International Food Festival transformed the Student Union into a vibrant celebration of global cultures, with students from 25 countries sharing traditional cuisine, music, and performances with the campus community.</p>
                    
                    <p>The event, organized by the International Student Office in partnership with cultural student organizations, featured authentic dishes prepared by international students and their families. From Korean kimchi and Ethiopian injera to Mexican tamales and Indian biryani, the festival offered a culinary journey around the world.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Food is such a powerful way to share culture and build connections," said Dr. Maria Gonzalez, Director of International Student Services. "This festival creates opportunities for our domestic and international students to learn from each other in a fun, welcoming environment."</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond the food offerings, the festival featured cultural performances throughout the day. Highlights included traditional Chinese lion dancing, Bollywood dance performances, African drumming, and a mariachi band. Students also set up information booths about their home countries, sharing photos, artifacts, and stories.</p>
                    
                    <p>The festival served as both a celebration and an educational opportunity. Many attendees learned about new cultures and made connections with international students. Several domestic students expressed interest in study abroad programs after conversations with their international peers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Junior international student Priya Patel from India, who helped organize the event, shared her perspective: "When I first arrived here, I was nervous about sharing my culture. Events like this show me how much people appreciate learning about different traditions. It makes me feel proud of where I come from."</p>
                    
                    <p>The festival also raised funds for the International Student Emergency Fund, which provides financial assistance to international students facing unexpected hardships. This year's event raised over $3,000 for the fund.</p>
                    
                    <p>Planning is already underway for next year's festival, with organizers hoping to expand to include even more countries and cultural activities. The International Student Office is also exploring the possibility of monthly cultural events throughout the academic year.</p>
